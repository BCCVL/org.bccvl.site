    "description": "The Vegetation Assets, States and Transitions (VAST) classification orders vegetation by degree of anthropogenic modification as a series of classes, from a residual or benchmark condition through to total removal. VAST is being developed to explicitly link land management and vegetation condition, to provide a mechanism to describe the effects of land management on vegetation condition and to contribute to the analysis of ecosystems services provided by vegetation.",
