The data are available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator). Bio-ORACLE data layers are created from monthly pre-processed satellite and in situ observations. Bio-ORACLE is developed by a team of marine researchers from the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), the University of Algarve, the University of Melbourne and Ghent University.
