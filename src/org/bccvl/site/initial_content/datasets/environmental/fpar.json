    "description": "Continental monthly time series MODIS-fPAR for April 2000 to April 2012 derived from NASA MODIS satellite imagery (MOD13Q1). fPAR is defined as the Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) intercepted by the sunlit vegetation canopy and is a measure of vegetation greenness. The fPAR time series data enables variation in primary productivity over time to be observed and analysed. fPAR can be used as components in landscape-scale ecosystem models and analyses of biomass production, carbon storage, habitat quality and disturbance regimes.",
